                    <p>In Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice you are the “one-armed wolf”, a disgraced and disfigured warrior rescued
                        from the brink of
                        death. Bound to protect a young lord who is the descendant of an ancient bloodline, you become the
                        target of many
                        vicious enemies, including the dangerous Ashina clan. When the young lord is captured, nothing will stop
                        you on a
                        perilous quest to regain your honor, not even death itself.

                    <p>America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of
                    Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters
                    in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of
                    America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice
                    between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.</p>
